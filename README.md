# serial-comunication-java-arduino
This project is based on serial communication between Arduino and Java UX application. The Serial Communication library ".jar" was provided by "RXTX binary builds by Mfizz Inc. (http://mfizz.com/). Please see http://mfizz.com/oss/rxtx-for-java for more info." The project consists of reading temperature and humidity values from Arduino Mega, read them on a Java Swing application which connects to:

1. Connect to database using JDBC driver provided by Oracle to connect to MySQL database.
2. Connect to Serial Ports to the Arduino Mega. 
3. Open serial Communication to obtain the values and begin to save them on the database. 

The project was developed for the Microcontroller Lecture. 

NOTE: to run the program please use: Eclipse or Spring STS IDE. Java JDK 8 is preffered.
